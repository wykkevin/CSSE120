"""
This module lets you practice the WAIT-FOR-EVENT pattern.

See your instructor for whether you should use:
The ITCH pattern:

   Initialize as needed so that the CONDITION can be TESTED.
   while <some CONDITION>: # Test the CONDITION, continue WHILE it is true.
       ...
       ...
       CHange something that (eventually) affects the CONDITION.
         (else otherwise you will be in an infinite loop)

or

The WHILE TRUE pattern:

     while True:
       ...
       if <event has occurred>:
           break
       ...

Ultimately you should be comfortable with both approaches.
