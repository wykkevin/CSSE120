Students:

Here is how you do today's exercise, in m1_Point.

Do TODO 1 as usual, then TODO 2.  It tells you to:
  -- With your instructor, understand these instructions.
  -- In m1_Point, write a two-line implementation of a Point
       class that (at that point) has NO methods.

Then, for each TODO from #3 to the end of the exercise, you will
do the following.  (This shows the TODO for the __INIT__ method.
The TODOs for the remaining methods follow the same form.)

    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # TODO: 3.
    #   a. Read the above specification of the   __INIT__   method.
    #        Do NOT proceed until you understand WHAT it should do
    #        (but not necessarily HOW it will do it).
    #        NO CODE YET.  Ask questions as needed.
    #
    #   b. Examine the EXAMPLE code in the green doc-string above.
    #        Make sure that you see how that code works, and how it
    #        TESTS the __INIT__ method.  ** ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED. **
    #
    #   c. Select the code in the EXAMPLE in the green doc-string above.
    #        Copy-and-paste it into this  TEST_INIT  function, putting
    #        the copied code just below the PRINT statements below.
    #
    #      Use the Tab and Shift-Tab keystrokes as needed to fix the
    #        indentation of the pasted code.
    #
    #      You cannot RUN the copy-pasted tests because you
    #        have not (yet) implemented the  __INIT__  method.
    #
    #   e. Implement and test the  __INIT__  method.
    #        Make sure that you UNDERSTAND your code and are not just
    #        "pattern matching" from examples.
    #        ASK QUESIONS AS NEEDED.  COMMIT YOUR WORK.
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 We may code the first few TODO's together.
