# Students:
#
# These problems have DIFFICULTY and TIME ratings:
#  DIFFICULTY rating:  1 to 10, where:
#     1 is very easy
#     3 is an "easy" Test 2 question.
#     5 is a "typical" Test 2 question.
#     7 is a "hard" Test 2 question.
#    10 is an EXTREMELY hard problem (too hard for a Test 2 question)
#
#  TIME ratings: A ROUGH estimate of the number of minutes that we
#     would expect a well-prepared student to take on the problem.
#
#  IMPORTANT: For ALL the problems in this module,
#    if you reach the time estimate and are NOT close to a solution,
#    STOP working on that problem and ASK YOUR INSTRUCTOR FOR HELP
#    on it, in class or via Piazza.
