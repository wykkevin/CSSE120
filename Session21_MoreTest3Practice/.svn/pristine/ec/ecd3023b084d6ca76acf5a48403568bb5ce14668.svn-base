# Students:
#
# These problems have DIFFICULTY and TIME ratings:
#  DIFFICULTY rating:  1 to 10, where:
#     1 is very easy
#     3 is an "easy" Test 2 question.
#     5 is a "typical" Test 2 question.
#     7 is a "hard" Test 2 question.
#    10 is an EXTREMELY hard problem (too hard for a Test 2 question)
#
#  TIME ratings: A ROUGH estimate of the number of minutes that we
#     would expect a well-prepared student to take on the problem.
#
#  IMPORTANT: For ALL the problems in this module,
#    if you reach the time estimate and are NOT close to a solution,
#    STOP working on that problem and ASK YOUR INSTRUCTOR FOR HELP
#    on it, in class or via Piazza.

    What comes in:  A TUPLE of LISTs,
                    where the interior lists contain only integers.
    What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., none)
    Side effects:  The argument is MUTATED so that:
      -- the 1st 0 in the given tuple of lists is changed to 1.
      -- the 2nd 0 in the given tuple of lists is changed to 2.
      -- the 3rd 0 in the given tuple of lists is changed to 3.
           etc.
    Example:
      If the given tuple of lists is:
          ([8, 4, 0, 9], [77, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0], [4, 4, 4], [4, 0, 4])
      then AFTER this function is called with that tuple of lists,
      the tuple of lists has been MUTATED to:
          ([8, 4, 1, 9], [77, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0], [4, 4, 4], [4, 5, 4])
    Note that:
      -- If there are no zeros in the given tuple of lists,
           then this function does nothing.
      -- After this function call, the tuple of lists IN THE CALLER
           should contain no zeros.
