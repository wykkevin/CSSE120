    See   problem3_picture.pdf   in this project for pictures
    that may help you better understand the following specification:

    What comes in:
      -- A positive integer m.
      -- An rg.Point.
      -- A positive integer size.
      -- A string that can be used as a color, e.g. 'blue'.
    What goes out:  Nothing (i.e., None).
    Side effects:
    -- Constructs and displays an rg.RoseWindow
         that is 700 wide by 200 tall.
    -- Draws, on the rg.RoseWindow,   m  rg.Square / rg.Circle pairs,
       where:
         -- The first rg.Square:
              -- is centered at the given rg.Point
              -- has the given  size  as the length
                   of each of its sides.
         -- The first rg.Circle:
              -- is circumscribed by the first rg.Square
                   (see  problem3_picture  for what this looks like)
              -- has the given color as its fill color.
         -- Each subsequent rg.Square / rg.Circle pair is
              40 pixels to the right and 10 pixels down from the
              previous rg.Square / rg.Circle pair.

    -- Waits for the user to click the mouse
         (with an appropriate message prompting the user to do so),
         then closes the window.

        :type point:  rg.Point
