# This line is a COMMENT -- a note to human readers of this file.
# When a program runs, it ignores everything from a  # (hash)  mark
# to the end of the line with the  #  mark.
#
# We call files that have Python code in them MODULES.  Line 1 of this
# module (look at it now) prints onto the Console the STRING
#   Hello, World
# Anything surrounded by quote marks (single or double) is a STRING.

# TODO: 1.
#   (Yes, that means for YOU to DO things per these instructions:)
#
#   Run this module by using the green arrow on the toolbar up top.
#   After running, find the Console tab (to the right) and confirm that
#        Hello, World
#   did indeed get printed (displayed) on the Console.

# TODO: 2.
#   Notice the small horizontal BLUE bars on the scrollbar-like thing
#   on the right.  Each blue bar indicates a TODO in this module.
#
#     a. You can use the blue bars to go from one TODO to the next
#        by clicking on the blue bars.  ** Try that now. **
#
#     b. When you have completed a TODO, you should change the word
#          TODO
#        to
#          DONE.
#        Try it now on line 16 above, and note that its blue bar on
#        the scrollbar-like thing to the right has gone away.
#
# If you change TODOs to DONEs like this, you can tell when you have
# finished all the exercises in a module -- there will be no blue bars
# left on the scrollbar-like thing to the right.
#
# You have now completed TODO #2, so change its TODO on line 26 to DONE
# (and proceed similarly for all forthcoming TODOs in this course).
#

#
# TODO: 3.
#   Add another   print   statement below the current Line 1.
#   It should print any string that you want (but keep it G-rated!)
#   Test your code by re-running this module and looking at
#   the Console to be sure that your string printed as expected.
#

#
# TODO: 4.
#   Add yet another   print   statement, just below the previous one.
#   This one should print the product of 3,607 and 34,227.
#   Let the computer do the arithmetic for you (no calculators!).
#   You do NOT have to use strings for this, so no quote marks!
#
#   TEST your code by re-running this module, then asking someone
#   whom you trust:  What number did your   print   display?
#   (HINT: It is an INTERESTING number.)  Get help if yours is wrong.

#
# TODO: 5.
#   Look at the list of files in this project in the
#     PyDev Package Explorer
#   to the left.
#   Note that this file (m2_hello_world.py) has a little black dot
#   to the left of the filename.  That means that you have
#   made changes to this file that you have not yet turned in.
#
#   COMMIT your work (which turns it in) by selecting (clicking on)
#   the file with the black dot (or the entire project if you prefer)
#   and then do     SVN ~ Commit...    from the SVN menu at the top.
#
#   Then check that the black symbol beside the file name in the
#     PyDev Package Explorer   on the left has gone away.
#   That's how you can tell that you have turned in your work.
#
#   Oh, one more thing:
#   Do you have any blue bars left on the on the scrollbar-like thing
#   to the right?  If so, click on each blue bar and change
#   its TODO to DONE.  Then run the file to save it, and COMMIT again.
#
#   You can COMMIT as often as you like.  DO FREQUENT COMMITS.
