"""
Demonstrates using OBJECTS via Turtle Graphics.
It is the same   m3_turtles.py   except that it organizes
the code into FUNCTIONS and then defines ADDITIONAL functions.

Concepts include:
  -- CONSTRUCT an INSTANCE of a CLASS (we call such instances OBJECTS).
  -- Make an object   ** DO **   something by using a METHOD.
  -- Reference an object's   ** DATA **   by using an INSTANCE VARIABLE.

Also:
  -- ASSIGNING a VALUE to a NAME (VARIABLE).
  -- ORGANIZING code into FUNCTIONS.
  -- MAIN as the place where execution starts.
  -- CALLING functions.

#
# DONE: 2.
#
#  You should have RUN the PREVIOUS module and SKIMMED its code.
#  (Do so now if you have not already done so.)
#
#  THIS module is the SAME as the PREVIOUS module, except for its
#  comments and the fact that the calls in   main  are "commented out".
#
#  1. Look at the definition of the  main  function below,
#     at Lines 81 to 85.  Note that the calls that it makes
#     to four of the five example functions are "commented out" --
#     they have a hash mark in front of them, making them comments
#     (and hence they will not run).
#
#  2. RUN this program.  It will run the function call in main
#     that is NOT commented-out, that is, it will call the
#        draw_squares_in_squares
#     function.
#
#  3. Modify the definition of the   draw_squares_in_squares   function
#     (it starts at Line 188) in ANY way you like.
#          ** ANYTHING ** is OK.
#
#     CHALLENGE: Can you make an even cooler picture that the one
#     that you start with?
#
#     If you get errors, NO WORRIES -- ask for help if you are in class,
#     or just leave them as errors if you are doing this after class.
#
#  4. Repeat step 3 a few times, with any functions that you like.
#     Don't forget to "un-comment" the function call in main to make
#     them run.
#
#       ****************************************************************
#       ** You are NOT expected to understand much of ANYTHING
#       ** in this module yet.  Just enjoy playing with it
#       ** as a preview of forthcoming sessions.
#       ****************************************************************
#
#  5. After you have made a few changes (or more, if you wish),
#     COMMIT your work (which turns it in) by selecting this file
#     and doing     SVN ~ Commit.  If your code is broken, it
#     will ask you if you really want to Commit -- respond Yes.
